# Minesweeper
A simple implementation of the classic Minesweeper game using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## How to Play
Objective: Uncover all cells that do not contain mines.

## Gameplay:

- Click on a cell to reveal it:

- If it's a mine, the game ends.

- If it's not a mine, the cell displays the number of adjacent mines.

Use this information to deduce and avoid mines.

Right-click (or use the designated flagging method) to mark cells you suspect contain mines.
